# TabGrid

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

A local Chrome extension that displays tab and tab group thumbnails in one visual grid. Search, organize, and personalize your workspace.

## A closer look

**Find your way through open tabs.** Browse page previews and groups in one grid, then search titles or URLs and narrow the results with filters.

**Make the workspace yours.** Choose Classic, Flat, or Glassmorphism, switch between light and dark, and personalize fonts, colors, and backgrounds.

## Install

Requires **Chrome 120 or later**.

1. [**Click here**](https://github.com/Morikana39/TabGrid/releases/latest/download/TabGrid.zip) to download the latest version, or open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Morikana39/TabGrid/releases/latest) and choose **TabGrid.zip** under **Assets**.
2. Extract `TabGrid.zip` and keep the extracted folder somewhere permanent.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and turn on **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted TabGrid folder.
5. Open Chrome’s Extensions menu and pin **TabGrid**.
6. Click the extension’s icon to open TabGrid.

For illustrated instructions, see [Chrome’s installation guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).

**Updating:** download the latest `TabGrid.zip` from the release link above, extract it, and replace the existing installation folder. Then click **Reload** for TabGrid at `chrome://extensions`, then reopen TabGrid.

The release package contains runtime files and license notices, excluding development fixtures, screenshots, source maps, and unused dependency files. To build it from source, see [Development](#development).

## Use TabGrid

- Click a tab to switch to it or a group to browse its tabs. Search titles or URLs, and use **Filters**, **Sort**, and **Card size** to adjust the view.
- Drag cards to reorder or group them. Reordering requires **Tab order** with text search and non-group filters cleared. Enable **Show all windows** to move cards between windows.
- Choose **⋮ → Select tabs** for bulk actions. Close cards with **×**, and use **Undo** or **Recently closed** to restore them in regular windows. Idle tabs are not automatically closed.
- Press **/** to search, **Ctrl+Z** (Windows/Linux) or **⌘Z** (Mac) to undo outside text fields, and **Escape** to dismiss menus. Optional swipe-to-close and tab-switch closing are available in settings.

## Make it yours

Open **⋮ → Extension settings**; changes save automatically. Choose a language, light or dark mode, visual style, colors, fonts, and a custom background. Adjust search, tab behavior, shortcuts, preview quality, and storage limits.

Settings can be exported or imported as JSON. Backups exclude browsing history, tab URLs, screenshots, and custom backgrounds.

## Privacy and offline use

The interface, settings, fonts, and tab organization work locally without a server or cloud sync. Websites still need their usual connectivity. Previews and browsing-related data stay in local Chrome storage; optional bookmark, Reading List, and site-muting permissions are requested when used.

Chrome controls screenshot access. For restricted pages, open TabGrid through its toolbar icon or shortcut while the target page is active; capture may still be refused. Opening an existing TabGrid tab directly uses the latest saved preview. File pages need Chrome’s file-access permission.

Enable **Allow in Incognito** to use TabGrid in private windows. Regular and private tabs stay separate; Incognito does not save screenshots, search history, or Undo records. Chrome may still record TabGrid closures in Recently closed; restored duplicate grids remain open to avoid a close/restore loop.

Thank you to the open-source projects behind TabGrid:

- [Material Design motion](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion) — reference for restrained card-return motion, implemented through the existing AutoAnimate effects.
- [Google Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) — bundled menu and settings icons ([Apache 2.0](assets/icons/material/LICENSE)).
- [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) — drag-and-drop ordering ([MIT](node_modules/sortablejs/LICENSE)).

- [Liquid DOM](https://github.com/AndrewPrifer/liquid-dom) — WebGPU wallpaper refraction for controls, filter panels, menus, dialogs, and slider surfaces, plus live springs and easing for Glassmorphism interactions ([MIT](assets/licenses/liquid-dom.txt)). Uses a local image texture, so the experimental HTML-in-Canvas flag is not required; CSS is used when WebGPU or a custom background is unavailable.

The material styles draw visual inspiration from [Flat UI](https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI), [liquidGL](https://github.com/naughtyduk/liquidGL), [neumorphism](https://github.com/adamgiebl/neumorphism), and [clay.css](https://github.com/codeAdrian/clay.css). These styles are implemented in TabGrid’s own CSS; those projects’ runtimes are not bundled.

Keep the bundled dependency license files when packaging the extension, including the separate Liquid DOM layout notice. Third-party license notices are included with the libraries, [bundled fonts](assets/fonts/README.md), and [Material Design icons](assets/icons/material/README.md).

Restricted-page capture uses Chrome’s documented [captureVisibleTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-captureVisibleTab) and [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) APIs. [Tab Thumbnails](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-thumbnails/adcmjkdmkpfdlhinedckkklaklijifpo) was inspected as a behavioral reference; no code or assets from it are included. Its inspected distribution did not contain a reuse license.

## Development

Run `npm test` and `npm run check`. For a local UI fixture, run `node tests/preview-server.mjs` and open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. The fixture uses simulated tabs. See [verification notes](docs/verification.md) for tested behavior and remaining native-browser checks.

Run `npm run package` with Node.js 20 or later to create `dist/TabGrid/` and `dist/TabGrid.zip`. The packager follows local runtime imports and keeps third-party notices; no additional build dependencies are required. Translations live in `locales/`, with Chrome metadata in `_locales/`. Keep placeholder numbers aligned between languages and use translated text only for interface messages, never for user content.
